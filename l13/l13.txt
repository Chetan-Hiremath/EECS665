1. Why the code is obfuscated?
The code is obfuscted because the return value is actually 15 in the dyn.s file even though the return value is 7 in the base.s file. It happens by compiling the bytes in the base.s file with the same bytes from the dyn.s file. Obfuscation does mean that it might change the behavior of a program, so it changes the program's value and gives you a different result after you compile the code. But you can change the byte's return value from 7 to 15 in the dyn.s file and check the overwritten byte's return value with the objdump command line for the purpose of obfuscation.
