Part 1:

The below code for the GDB confinguration file will add a breakpoint for the class and print a strack track when that breakpoint is encountered. 

set confirm off
set breakpoint pending on

break ToDoError::ToDoError()
commands
        where
end

define comp
        set args 1 2 3 4 5 9
        run
end


Part 2:

1. What is the gdb command to inspect the value of the register %rax?
The gdb command to inspect the value of the register %rax is the p $rax command.

2. What is the gdb command to inspect the value at (i.e. pointed to by) the register %rax?
The gdb command to inspect the value at the register %rax is the p/x $rax command.
 
3. What is the gdb command to set the value of the register %rax?
The gdb command to set the value of the register %rax is the set %rax command.

4. What is the gdb command to show the value of all registers?
The gdb command to show the value of the registers is the info registers command.

Part 3:

1. How big is the activation record of the current function? Hint: Consider the values of %rbp and %rsp.
The size of the activation record of the current function is 32-byte. It is determined by the reigsters' values, which are 0x7ffffffedfd8 and 0x7ffffffedfd8, since the size depends on the program.

2. What is the location to which the current function will return? Hint: Consider the values of the saved instruction pointer. (%rip)
The location that returns the current function is 0x401023.

3. What is the value of the first local variable (It is of 8 bytes)?
The value of the first local variable is 4202496. 

4. What is the value at the 8-byte global at label GBL? Hint: Use the objdump -Dwrt command to find the address of GBL.
The value at the 8-byte global at label GBL is 0x000000000040101e.
